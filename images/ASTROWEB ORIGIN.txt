Software requirements for VTS
==================================================================================

This page describes the software requirements for proper operation of the VTS toolkit.

            I decided to go to Bangor during my international semester, for the
            living environment, the green and refreshing landscapes, unless it's to finally be able to do like Harry
            Potter
            in the libraries of course!
            <br>
            In my opinion, the engineering curriculum lacks a creative side, so being able to choose your theme freely
            is a
            very good educational choice for me.<br>
            The purpose of this site is purely contemplative, I unfortunately can't deal with all the fascinating
            subjects
            related to astrophysics simply because of lack of time, but I will continue to improve my site as my
            knowledge
            grows. <

.. _Software_requirements_for_VTS#Write_access_permission:

Write access permission
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VTS needs write access permission in its whole folder hierarchy. Many tools create temporary files for configuration and visualization. Moreover, installation of new VTS clients consists in copying the client directory in the ``VTS/Apps`` folder.

System font size
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VTS is currently designed with a compact display. Some UI might be better looking by setting the font scaling factor on Windows: Right click on Desktop, Personalize, Display, Check SMaller (100%)
